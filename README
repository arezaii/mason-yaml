This is an attempt to replace the Chapel YAML package with a mason package.


Make sure mason external has been initialized:
`mason exteranl --setup`

Then, to make this work, you'll need to install the `libyaml` package by using
`mason external install libyaml`

Check that it is working by running `mason test`
